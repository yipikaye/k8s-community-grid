## Kubernetes Deployment For World Community Grid

This is a simple way to run the World Community Grid on Kubernetes.

This project exists to make it easier to run World Community Grid on cloud deployments to further cancer research.

Helping the fight to cure cancer is as simple as running the following:
```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yipikaye/k8s-community-grid/master/k8s-community-grid.yaml
```

## Docker
No Kubernetes? Thats OK.

You can still cure cancer!
```
docker pull yipikaye/community-worker
```


### Thanks for joining the fight
