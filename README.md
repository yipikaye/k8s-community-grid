Kubernetes Deployment For World Community Grid

Small project I am setting up to run the World Community Grid on NFV Deployments built with Kubernetes CaaS.

Focused on Curing Cancer

Helping the fight to cure cancer is as simple as running the following:
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yipikaye/k8s-community-grid/master/k8s-community-grid.yaml
