**Kubernetes Deployment For World Community Grid**

This is a simple way to run the World Community Grid on Kubernetes.

This project exists to make it easier to run World Community Grid on cloud deployments to further cancer research.

Helping the fight to cure cancer is as simple as running the following:
```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yipikaye/k8s-community-grid/master/k8s-community-grid.yaml
```

** Thanks for joining the fight **
